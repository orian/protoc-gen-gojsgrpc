# JavaScript gRPC extension 
It allows to use a gRPC implementation of a service and plug it as a HTTP server for JavaScript client.
 
Code for a backend:
protoc-gen-gojs

The JavaScript client is generated by a plugin:
github.com/orian/protoc-gen-jsgrpc

##Missing features:
 - no streams
 
I'm open for patches.
